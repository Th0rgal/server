## What is cash.place for?

cash.place is a platform for secure bitcoin transactions: if you are a customer you are sure that the seller will give you what you paid for and if you are a seller you are sure that you will receive your payment. Unlike traditional middlemen, cash.place is automatic and therefore very fast: if there is no dispute requiring human intervention, a transaction will only take a few minutes. No matter what happens, you will only pay a one percent fee for this service.

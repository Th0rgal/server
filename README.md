## What is cash.place for?

cash.place is a platform for secure bitcoin transactions: if you are a customer you are sure that the seller will give you what you paid for and if you are a seller you are sure that you will receive your payment. Unlike traditional middlemen, cash.place is automatic and therefore very fast: if there is no dispute requiring human intervention, a transaction will only take a few minutes. If the transaction is successful, you will only pay a one percent fee for this service,
you won't be charged for a refund.

## Transaction process

- the spender or the receiver creates the ticket, set his password and share the link with the other party
- the ticket creator defines the amount and confirm
- the spender sends his bitcoin to a generated address
- when the transaction is confirmed, the btc receiver sends his product or service
- the btc spender confirms the reception (and the btc are transfered) or opens an issue
- A human operator comes to solve the problem if there is one or the ticket is automatically deleted within 24 hours
